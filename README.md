# DataQuest Project 11: Fandango Movie Ratings:  

This is the eleventh project I completed in the "Data Analyst in Python" and "Data Scientist in Python" paths from Dataquest. The goal of this project was to investigate whether there were changes in the way the movie site Fandango rounded the movie ratings on their website after an article in 2015 showed they were shifting the ratings on their website towards more favorable ones. From a learning standpoint, the project was focused on using statistical methods to show trends in datasets.

## Prerequisites

This project requires both the Jupyter notebook as well as the `CSV` file containing the raw data of the survey.

To run this project, you will need `Jupyter Notebooks` with a python 3 kernel to be installed on your machine. Instructions on how to install `Jupyter Notebooks` can be found on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

The project itself is written in Python 3 and uses the modules `Numpy`, `Pandas`, `Seaborn`  and `matplotlib` to run. These can be installed by running `pip install <name of module>` in the console.
